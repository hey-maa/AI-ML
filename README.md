Parkinson's Diasease Detection Model
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, causing symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and balance problems. Early detection is crucial for managing the disease and improving the quality of life for those affected. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect Parkinson's disease using dataset from Kaggle and implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in Python.

Key Features: 

1.Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Loaded and understood the dataset.
Handled missing values and outliers.
Normalized features for better model performance.

2.Feature Selection:
Identified relevant features that contribute to Parkinson's disease detection.

3.Model Development:
Implemented an SVM algorithm to build the detection model.
Trained and tested the model using cross-validation techniques.

4.Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle. It typically includes various biomedical voice measurements from individuals, some of whom have Parkinson's disease. Key features include measures of vocal fundamental frequency, variation in amplitude, and other voice signal characteristics.
